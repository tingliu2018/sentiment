Introdution:
    Instruction on how to run genreate files and run the machine learning code:
    WARNING: Be sure to have all correct paths for the raw files and where you want your output to go.
    This can be done by changing the datasetBuilder and sBuilder String for the paths.
    
    1: Run main in datasetBuilder to build STree and SOSTree.
    2: Run the pre-processor code in the machine learning package.
    3: Run labelCleaner.java to clean up the label files that allows the machine learning to be ran.
    4: Execute the th command to start machine learning code.
    
    All classes and methods are comments on what you need to run them and what they do.
    
    This is a link to their repo for further instructions on their lstm package. 
    Fair Warning, the instructions in this repo are very confusing.

    Be sure to know lua because most of the package is written in lua.
